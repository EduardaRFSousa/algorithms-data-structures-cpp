# Algorithms and Data Structures in C++ 📚💻

This repository gathers my academic and practical implementations of **algorithms and data structures** in C++, developed during the *Algorithms and Data Structures* course at IFPE.  

The goal is to practice problem-solving, strengthen logical reasoning, and build a solid foundation in programming with **C++**.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered
- Arrays, Strings and Recursion  
- Matrix Problems (DFS, Backtracking, Traversal)  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Ordered Lists  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Hash Tables and Linked Lists  
- Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees  
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms  

---

## 🚀 Technologies
- **C++** (main language)  
- Standard libraries: `<vector>`, `<stack>`, `<queue>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, etc.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills**  
- Practice recursion, DFS, BFS, and backtracking  
- Implement classic data structures from scratch  
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
